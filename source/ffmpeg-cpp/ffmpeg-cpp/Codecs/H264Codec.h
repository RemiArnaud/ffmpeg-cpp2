  profile

  (automatic)

  The -profile:v option limits the output to a specific H.264 profile.
  Some devices (mostly very old or obsolete) only support the more limited 
  Constrained Baseline or Main profiles. 
  You can set these profiles with -profile:v baseline or -profile:v main.
  Most modern devices support the more advanced High profile.
  Unless you need to support limited devices the recommendation is to omit setting the profile which will allow x264 to automatically select the appropriate profile.

  tune

  You can optionally use -tune to change settings based upon the specifics of your input. Current tunings include:

    film – use for high quality movie content; lowers deblocking
    animation – good for cartoons; uses higher deblocking and more reference frames
    grain – preserves the grain structure in old, grainy film material
    stillimage – good for slideshow-like content
    fastdecode – allows faster decoding by disabling certain filters
    zerolatency – good for fast encoding and low-latency streaming
    psnr – ignore this as it is only used for codec development
    ssim – ignore this as it is only used for codec development

  preset

  Use the slowest preset that you have patience for. The available presets in descending order of speed are:

    ultrafast   // poor quality, fastest
    superfast
    veryfast
    faster
    fast
    medium – default preset
    slow
    slower
    veryslow  // slow, better quality
*/

/*
  crf

  The range of the CRF scale is 0–51, where 0 is lossless, 23 is the default.
  51 is worst quality possible. A lower value generally leads to higher quality,
  and a subjectively sane range is 17–28.
  Consider 17 or 18 to be visually lossless or nearly so; it should look the same 
  or nearly the same as the input but it isn't technically lossless. 

  When compiled with 10-bit support, x264's quantizer scale is 0–63
