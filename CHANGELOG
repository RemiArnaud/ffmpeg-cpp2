TODO : improve the demos (a bit confusing curently)
Improved indentation
Simplified the code
Added convertToRGB()  method in the Demuxer.
Added SetFileSink method in demuxer. Important second effect is that
we simplified the parameters number when using RawVideoFileSource
Continued to work at encode video from webcam

Simplifified the interface.

Added a new constructor in Demuxer class  Demuxer::Demuxer( AVFormatContext *, AVInputFormat *,   AVDictionary *)

The difficulty is : understand where is what in the sources ...

In another program (< 190 lines) I was able to :
- detect and use a Logitech C922 
- select mjpeg mode, 1920x1080@30fps
- take 100 colored (RGB24) frame 1920x1080@30fps
- save them in a given folder

N.B. : every image is nice, and is around 6MB ... means 600 MB in ~ 5 s !!


Improved RawVideoFileSource.cpp and RawVideoFileSource.h. Added a and implemented new Ctor :
- RawVideoFileSource::RawVideoFileSource(const char*, int, int, int, AVPixelFormat, FrameSink* frameSink);
- see : https://github.com/pijushbarik/videoreader-ffmpeg/pulls 

Tested a lot with Linux kernel IOCTL + v4l2 API. Extrelemy fast, but not exactly what I need.
I'll keeping the code around, just in case.

Tested videoreader-ffmpeg, https://github.com/ebachard/videoreader-ffmpeg





2020/04/27


Made the wecbam light shine :-)  (/dev/video0)

Added one script per demo. IMPROVE ME : add a demo CMakefile.txt or something like that
Improved the layout in the README
ffmpeg-cpp is now warnings free
Added linking to libva, libva*
Added VP9 Codec 
Renamed H264 codec in H264NV (NV for NVidia), to avoid confusion with the unaccelerated one.
Removed more warnings (unused variables).




2020/04/26


Added some codecs (generic files with AV_CODEC_ID's only + some private options)
Using .mp4 (VAAPI implementation 80% missing)
Added reference files
Created the documentation folder
Started acceleration works with VAAPI
Updated the TODO list
Clarified the Linux part in the README
Fixed more demos (print_info)
More cleanup
Fixed: the demos are warnings free
Added some little scripts to build every demo separately
FIXED : most of the demos work
Added missing information
Cosmetics

2020/04/23


Added all the changes making the demo to work
Moved the samples at a better location
Removed all getchar()
Added libvpx as dependancy
Fixed more Linux issues : updated the README to explain what has to be installed to be able to test the examples
Added a better fix in exceptions
Fixed more warnings (signed/unsigned, exceptions)
Fixed all build breakages : build completed, but zillions of warnings yet
Workarounded exceptions handling, to allow the build to complete (FIXME : fix that one day)
Fixed some strange headers issues
Updated the README file (added some Linux information)
Created a (newbie) CMakefile.txt.
Added licence GPL V3 to protect my changes, but this is for some time only.

Forked ffmpeg-cpp from https://github.com/Raveler/ffmpeg-cpp
Looks extremely interesting !
